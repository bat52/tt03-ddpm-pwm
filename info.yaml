  how_it_works: |
      This project implements three different architectures of Pulse Density Modulators (PDM), to compare performances and 
      implementation complexity of the different schemes.
      
      PDM modulators are of particular interest because exploiting oversampling, they allow to implement 
      Digital-to-Analog-Conversion (DAC) schemes with an equivalent resolution of multiple bits, based on 
      a single-bit digital output, by means of a straightforward analogue low-pass filter.      

      The PDM modulators implemented in this project are the following:
        1) Pulse Width Moulation (PWM)
        2) Dyadic Digital Pulse Modulation (DDPM)
        3) Sigma-Delta (SD)

      PWM is arguably the simplest and possibly most widespread PDM technology that is praised for its low complexity.      

      DDPM [1][2][3] is a type of digital modulation technique in which the pulse width are quantized in a dyadic manner, 
      meaning that they are quantized in powers of two, which allows for efficient implementation using binary arithmetic. 
      As a consequence, DDPM modulators are relatively inexpensive to deploy, with a complexity comparable to that of widespread 
      Pulse-Width Moduldation (PWM) modulators.

      SD modulators are perhaps the best-performing PDM technology, that is particularly well suited for higher resolution 
      data conversion, and typically find use in audio DACs and fractional PLLs. 
      In spite their good performaces, SD modulators are Infinite-Impulse-Response (IIR) closed-loop systems 
      which behavior depends on the input signal, resulting in a number of concerns (most notably stability), that typically
      require careful modeling of the systems and condition under which they will be required to operate.

      This design is separated into two section:
        1) a first instance of PWM, DDPM and SD fed by a static DC value (6bit) from the input pins
        2) a second instance of PWM, DDPM and SD fed sine look-up-table (LUT) that allows to evaluate the spectral content
        of the modulated signals.
